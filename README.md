## Information: 
IronAxe Launcher is a portable Minecraft Launcher, built for Simplicity and ease of use.
This launcher allows you to place a Version of Minecraft on a PC, USB Drive, SD Card, etc.
Even if the PC you're using doesn't have Java Installed (Or if you can't install it), then there is no
need to worry! This launcher allows you to Launch Minecraft using a portable version of Java 8!
On top of that, it is built on the 32bit architecture. Meaning that it will be almost impossible to find a PC that can't run this launcher, unless it's Windows 2000 or older. Meaning, that you can use this launcher on Windows XP or above; as long as you have the latest version of .NET framework installed (4.5+).
