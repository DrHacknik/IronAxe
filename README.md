# Information: 
IronAxe Launcher is a portable Minecraft Launcher, built for Simplicity and ease of use.
This launcher allows you to place a Version of Minecraft on a PC, USB Drive, SD Card, etc.
Even if the PC you're using doesn't have Java Installed (Or if you can't install it), then there is no
need to worry! This launcher allows you to Launch Minecraft using a portable version of Java 8!
On top of that, it is built on the 32bit architecture. Meaning that it will be almost impossible to find a PC that can't run this launcher, unless it's Windows 2000 or older. Meaning, that you can use this launcher on Windows XP or above; as long as you have the latest version of .NET framework installed (4.5+).

## Installation Instructions:


* Run the program and make sure that it downloads the necessary resources.
After downloading, a Installer will show; this is the Java Portable Installer. Make sure it installs within the directory "\bin\commonfiles\Java" or "\bin\commonfiles\Java64."
* Restart the program.
* Now, create a profile using the profile_create option.
* Now, load said profile. You can choose to load it with portable Java, or not. It may ask you if you want to set it as the default profile to load.
* **Optional:** You can set within the settings to load the default profile automatically when the program starts.
* Done! Just login to your account, and play!
* **Optional:** Copy your .minecraft folder (%APPDATA%/.minecraft) from your computer to the profile's folder that you created, if you want your login info, versions, mods, worlds, etc.

## FAQ:


* I get an error stating that "We cannot find the file minecraft.jar." If this is the case, use an existing one you may have, or download it via minecraft.net. Make sure this file is placed within the "/bin" directory in the folder for the application. If you cannot find the .jar file on Minecraft's website, or on your PC; use this link ![here](https://github.com/zoltx23/IronAxe/raw/master/Common/Resources/Java_Launcher/minecraft.jar?raw=true) .
* I get an error that has something to do with .NET Framework or a JIT error. Please report this error via GitHub in the issues section on the repository.
